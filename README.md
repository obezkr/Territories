be adjacent to your existing territory. As many points are added to your score as the cells are occupied by a 
rectangle. If you canâ€™t put a rectangle, you pass a move and lose 10 points. If you have a negative amount of points, 
you leave the game. The remaining players continue to play. The game ends when the whole territory is occupied or 
until one player remains. The winner is the player who has more points.
